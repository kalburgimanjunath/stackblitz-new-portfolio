# Belk's app/website has been experiencing exceptional sales performance compared to desktop and mobile sites.

Despite this success, there is room for improvement, mainly through a redesign. With their last update being some time ago, this presents a significant opportunity for the company. Belk has recently implemented new features such as after-pay and PayPal and has collaborated with Conns, Multi Tender Loyalty, and a new marketplace. These changes pave the way for prioritization of enhancing the user experience to ensure customer satisfaction. By improving the app's design and user experience, Belk can continue to thrive in the ever-evolving world of e-commerce.

# Despite having a talented UX team in place, the prospect of designing our entire website was a formidable challenge.

To ensure that we could manage our workload effectively and meet our deadlines, we decided to seek the assistance of a reputable agency. Their expertise and guidance proved invaluable, helping usremain organized and on track throughout the process.

Since we had to design several pages, we decided to create multiple problem statements. We then separated each task into its respective section.

# My Team

- Research Team : Ovative Team

- Lead Designer: Emily McCafferty

- UX Designer : Suyanti (Myself)

# Duration per Project

- 1-3 Months

# My Target Audience

- Senior Citizens

# Lesson Learned

There is a lot of learning curves in the process. Starting from doing the competitors analysis, creating assets and components, while maintaining and creating Design Systems. It is a fun process and definitely learnt a lot.

# Our Problem Statements

## Product Landing Page

Our insights show we need to improve the user's ability to navigate to the desired products by using a left navigational system. We also want to increase the speed at which they can purchase so that the user can add more products to their bag in a shorter amount of time, which improves usability.

## My Account

Having an older demographic, we must offer more context. In this redesign, our goal was to provide the user with more details (visually and written) about their order, order status, payment method, billing address, and wishlist.

## My Wishlist

In the past three months, there have been nearly 70k wishlist additions. This means that less than >1% of total site visits are engaging with this feature. Under 2% of visits to the cart utilize the option to move items out of the cart and into the wishlist. By engaging new design, we are hoping to bring more sales.

# Product Landing Page Research

The present study has investigated the performance of PLP on belk.com, a popular eCommerce platform.
